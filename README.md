# SecureChat

## Introduction

SecureChat is an e2e-encrypted, p2p chat that is built on top of IPFS for a distributed, highly available data store.

Users are identified by public keys, which are also used for encrypting and decrypting messages.  To simplify user creation, users can generate pub/priv keypairs using the application itself.

Currently, only text messaging will be supported, but the aim is to support multimedia content like images, gifs, and videos.

1. Use built-in ipfs/ipns keystore for identity or a separate private key managed by this executable?
